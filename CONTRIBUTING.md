## Contributing to Orion

### Filing Issues

**Suggestions**

The Orion project is meant to evolve with feedback - the project and its users greatly appreciate any thoughts on ways to improve the design or features. Please use the `enhancement` tag to specifically denote issues that are suggestions - this helps us triage and respond appropriately.

**Bugs**

As with all pieces of software, you may end up running into bugs. Please submit bugs as regular issues on GitHub - Orion developers are regularly monitoring issues and will try to fix open bugs quickly.

The best bug reports include a detailed way to predictably reproduce the issue, and possibly even a working example that demonstrates the issue.

### Contributing Code

The Orion project accepts and greatly appreciates contributions. The project follows the [fork & pull](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/#fork--pull) model for accepting contributions.

When contributing code, please also include appropriate tests as part of the pull request, and follow the same comment and coding style as the rest of the project. Take a look through the existing code for examples of the testing and style practices the project follows.

### Contributing Features

All pull requests for new features must go through the following process:
* Please familiarize yourself with the [Orion Design Principles](DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md)
* Start an Intent-to-implement GitHub issue for discussion of the new feature.
* LGTM from Tech Lead and one other core committer is required
* Development occurs on a separate branch of a separate fork, noted in the intent-to-implement issue
* A pull request is created, referencing the issue.
* Orion developers will provide feedback on pull requests, looking at code quality, style, tests, performance, and directional alignment with the goals of the project. That feedback should be discussed and incorporated
* LGTM from Tech Lead and one other core committer, who confirm engineering quality and direction.
