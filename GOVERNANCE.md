# Orion open source governance

The Orion project's chief and primary concern is with the development of Orion HTML, an open source library of components which increase developer efficiency and provide a consistent look and feel to web applications across Autodesk. The look and feel of components is based on Autodesk Human Interface guidelines and the various product teams that contribute to Orion. The Orion project's governance model thus reflects only the need to steer the engineering direction of the components and not any other activities which are out of scope.

Our governance model is as follows:

* There is a single Tech Lead, who will have the final say on all decisions regarding technical direction.
* The Tech Lead directs the Core Committers, whose members include the Tech Lead and those who have been appointed by the Tech Lead as Core Committers.
* In the event the Tech Lead is unable to perform his or her duties, or abdicates, the Core Committers can select a new Tech Lead from amongst themselves.
* In the event there are no Core Committers, Autodesk Inc. will appoint one.

## Core Committers:

* Tech Lead: Cameron Westland (@camwest)
