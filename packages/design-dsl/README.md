# design-dsl

This package is here to explore concepts for a design domain specific language.

## 1. primitives

How do we describe the properties of primitives efficiently?

* containers
* text
* images

## 2. composition

* How are primitives combined into more complex components

## 3. abstraction

* How do we hide lower level implementation details

## Assumptions

* Bottom out on a CSS style box model
